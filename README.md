# HTTP Status Codes for TypeScript

Individual exports for each HTTP Status Code.

This package differs from other previous implementations in that each status code is its own individual export.

To install as NPM package:
```
npm install --save gist:0caeaa5c6d457b1750f25fb2a256f004
```

Usage: 
```typescript
import { Unauthorized, NotFound } from "ts-http-status-codes";
```
